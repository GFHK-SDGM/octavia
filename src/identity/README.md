## Identity replies
This folder contains a list of identity reply strings, providing a basis for Octavia to conduct device response recreation. None of the binary files are copyrightable under any copyright law, as they do not contain actual ROM data, only how to respond to device identity requests.

### Files
- `list.tsv`: List of the IDs and their respective device models.
- `identity.bin`: The merged binary pool of all identity reply data. Must be built via `shx datagen`!
- `identity.txt`: The index for the binary pool. Must be built via `shx datagen`!
