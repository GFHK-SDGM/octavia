## Files
Only files ending in `.mjs` are meant to be used as a library. Files prefixed with `xp_` are tested to work on Windows XP (Chrome 49 and Firefox 52 ESR).

* `state.mjs`: MIDI processing core.
* `basic.mjs`: The bare minimum to get you started on writing visualizers. Requires `state.mjs`.
* `cambiare.mjs`: Batteries-included full-blown visualizer as a module.
