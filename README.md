## What is Octavia?
The current MIDI landscape is a dumpster fire, at least in the FOSS world. Only proprietary software solutions respect existing MIDI standards, while the FOSS ecosystem largely ignores or even violates the conventions, with TiMidity as the single exception. Octavia, born out of being fed up by the existing antics exhibited by existing FOSS solutions, aims to reach full compliance with existing MIDI standards (MT-32, GM, XG, GS, GM2 and etc.), while exposing simple yet powerful interfaces for developers to build upon.

With Octavia, no longer will you worry about standard compliance. Just focus on building what's important, be it visualizers, state browsers, event routers or even realtime event translators, Octavia's got your back. Feel free to test Octavia's capabilities with all available demos.

## Why Octavia over others?
* Free, libre and open-source, under GNU LGPL v3.0.
* Developed with Firefox and an open Web in mind.
* Compliant to existing standards.
* Behaves like a real MIDI module, doing most of the heavy-lifting for you.
* Supports 8 ports, 128 channels, 512-voice polyphony maximum. More than you'll ever need.
* Built-in support for multiple plug-in cards and tons of other devices.
* Emits warnings when MIDI programming errors are spotted, reducing chances of faulty programming.
* Available in JS (browser and Deno).
* No modification required to run in hardened forks of browsers, like Tor Browser, Cromite and LibreWolf.
* Wide support of bank mapping and bitmaps via [`midi-db`](https://github.com/ltgcgo/midi-db).

## Supported targets
Octavia offers support to a wide range of targets, most of them being either GM-compliant or having strong historical importance. Read the [support page](https://kb.ltgc.cc/octavia/support/target.html) for more information.
